This document outlines data current data gathering procedures, and should be updated as our approach changes over time.

Main datasets to use are the "Data Panel" dataset in 2021 and the "Data for Table 2.1" in 2020 (subject to change).
Meaning of variable names is included in each respective report. We might want to focus on Life Ladder scores, since they represent a large portion of subjective well-being.
We still want to use datasets used for some of the figures, especially if they include region indicators.
